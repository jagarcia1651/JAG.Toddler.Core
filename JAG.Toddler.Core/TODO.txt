Views:

	Planning:

		I want to move the jquery to a separate file.

		Input cells need to be tagged and watched.
		Dynamic cells need to be updated on input.

Models/View Models: 

	Planning:
		An IMU property should be added to either the model or view model.  It is necessary to calculate client side content.

CDNs:

	Need to ensure I'm including all libraries I am using in production/development under appropriate environment tags in _layout.
