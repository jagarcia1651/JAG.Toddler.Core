Modules:
	Planning:

	All relevant data for the planning module is being passed from the database to the view.
	Need to finish implementing dynamic input in the view then pass back updated data to database.
	Where should data validation take place?  Perhaps several layers.
	Need to begin implementing repository layer to clean up model and view model construction.

Views:

	Planning:

		Razor needs to be consistently wrapped in table cells OR wrap conditional table cell production.  Currently exists both ways within the view.

		I want to move the jquery to a separate file.

		Input cells need to be tagged and watched.
		Dynamic cells need to be updated on input.

		Second form needs to postback updated Model to controller.

Models/View Models: 

	Planning:
		An IMU property should be added to either the model or view model.  It is necessary to calculate client side content.

CDNs:

	Need to ensure I'm including all libraries I am using in production/development under appropriate environment tags in _layout.

Controllers:

	Planning:
		
		Need post hander to passback updated model from planning view.
